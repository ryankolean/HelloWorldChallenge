Description
	Day 0:
		I got the challenge and started by analyzing all the different tasks that I would have to complete.
		I created the plan.odt file to stay organized and as a sort of to-do work list.
		I knew that I wanted to get the front end up with some simple html, but also that I wanted to make
		it look decent. So I got a fresh copy of Bootstrap 3 and started laying out the form for the
		registration page. After, I made the confirmation page as well. I added front end validation and 
		response with bootstrap validator so that the user has immediate information on if their input is acceptable.
	Day 1:
		I wanted to have the database running by the end of the day so I worked on finalizing the registration form. Next, I got to work with php and mysql making a php script that would insert
		the form information into the database. Once running, I transitioned to working on the report php code.
		Finally, I touched up the report page with some html and bootstrap layouts to make it look nice.
		Before going to bed, I asked my friends on Facebook to try and break it. Luckily, I had sql injection handled
		as some of my more tech savy friends tried several attempts.
	Day 2:
		Updated to mysqli in the php code and decided to make sure that even php "code" accepted by the database as
		a string would be output on the report page. Touched up a few cosmetics with bootstrap. Uploaded final version to website and github. Completed documentation
		
Final Notes:
	I would like to thank HelloWorld for the challenge. I welcome any questions or criticisms that you may have.
